            <p>Let me begin by introducing myself first. My name is <strong>Vince Enriquez</strong> and I am 19 years old. I immigrated to <em>Canada</em> in 2012 after 
            spending the first 11 years of my life in the <em>Philippines.</em> During my leisure/free time, I usually spend it by 
            <strong>browsing the internet, watching videos, playing video games, and watching live sports on TV 
            (especially basketball and football)</strong>. In terms of my previous school experience, I graduated from elementary 
            school in 2014 and graduated from high school in 2019. I have had some previous post-secondary experience in <em>Vancouver Community College 
            (VCC).</em> in the previous year, as I took <strong>Anatomy and Physiology</strong> and tried to pursue a career in the medical
            field before I decided to change course and instead pursue a career in Information Technology by taking 
            the <strong>two-year CIT diploma program in BCIT</strong>. The factors that caused me to choose BCIT as a post-secondary
            institution of choice is that it will help me to explore the world of computers and technology in further 
            detail so that I am able to have the tools and resources I need to pursue a successful work career in 
            computers and information systems in the future, especially in work companies such as <em>Microsoft</em>. 
            </p> 
       
            <p> During the <strong>summertime,</strong> me and my family usually likes to go out on different places
            and different countries. Some of the places that I have visited during the summer include my home country
            of the <strong> Philippines in 2016, </strong> the city of <strong>Los Angeles in 2015, 2018, and 2019 to visit
            my cousins from my dad's side of the family, </strong> and the <strong>city of Portland and the Oregon coast
            in 2014.</strong></p>
       
            <p> Currently, my mom (born in 1968) works in <strong>Downtown Vancouver,</strong> my dad (born in 1966) works 
            in <strong>Richmond,</strong> and my older brother (born in 1999) also studies in BCIT in the 
            <strong>Electrical Engineering program.</strong> My brother is planning to graduate in 2023, while I am planning
            to graduate in late 2022 or possibly 2023 as well.</p>
